            <p>According to the Nation Geographic it's estimated that about
               1 in 6 Americans could go hungry as the Coronavirus pandemic
               continues. Even prior to the pandemic, according to the U.S 
               Department of Agriculture, about 13.7 million households 
               experinced some sort of food insecurity during 2019. This
               means that about 35 million Americans were unable to get
               enough food or were uncertain as to when their next meal
               would come from.

        <h2>Together we can help those in need</h2>
        <p>
            Many people who have lost their job because of the pandemic are now struggling to keep food
            on the table. This is why non-profit organizations exist in order to assist those in need 
            through food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other community programs.
